## Summary

In the context of advancing autonomous driving, the persistent challenge of parking
necessitates exploration into Reinforcement Learning (RL). This project addresses
the pertinent problem of parking difficulty despite driving competence, aiming to
determine if RL can effectively facilitate autonomous parking within a simulated
environment. Leveraging Unity’s ML-Agents toolkit and simulated vehicles, the
project’s solution involved RL-based simulations. Despite initial obstacles with Sol
and Carla, the transition to Unity yielded notable advancements. The developed RL
strategy exhibited consistent parking performance across various starting locations,
showing promise in addressing the parking problem. However, limited generalization
and underutilization of the second parking space were observed. Further
exploration into hyperparameters, reward functions, and alternative algorithms like
SAC is essential for refinement. Notably, the project’s model required an extensive
training period to achieve consistent and satisfactory parking efficiency.
